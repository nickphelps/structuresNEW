                        </ul>

                        license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h2><strong>3. Disclaimer</strong></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The materials on Structures New's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Structures New makes no 
                            warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without 
                            limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                             non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>
                        <li>Further, Structures New does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, 
                            likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to 
                            such materials or on any sites linked to this site.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><strong>4. Limitations</strong></h2>
                    <p>In no event shall Structures New or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for 
                        loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on 
                        Structures New's website, even if Structures New or a Structures New authorized representative has been notified orally 
                        or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
                         or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                            Structures New does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. 
                            Structures New may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However 
                            Structures New does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
                    <h2><strong>6. Links</strong></h2>
                    <p>Structures New has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents

                    <h2><strong>7. Modifications</strong></h2>
                    <p>Structures New may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you 
                        are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>    
                    <h2><strong>8. Governing Law</strong></h2>
                    <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas and you irrevocably submit to 
                        the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.</p>
